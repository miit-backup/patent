Our invention is a specific, functional tool with proven performance (**up to 99.3% accuracy**) that solves an immediate problem for five distinct crops.<br>**2. Ready for Deployment:** Our tool is a practical, ready-to-use solution, not a high-level idea. |
| **5. 202521019962** | SMART AGRICULTURE: EARLY TOMATO LEAF DISEASE DETECTION... | A mobile application for detecting tomato leaf diseases, designed to work offline on a phone. | A custom-built **CNN with 8 convolutional blocks** processes leaf images directly on the user's device (edge computing). | Tomato | Leaves | **10 specific tomato leaf diseases** (the patent does not name them). | **96% accuracy.** | **1. Unmatched Versatility:** This is a key differentiator. Their tool is highly specialized for one plant (tomato). Our tool is a powerful, multi-plant platform serving **five different agricultural sectors**.<br>**2. Centralized Backend Power:** Theirs runs on-device, which can drain battery and limit model complexity. Our backend approach means the user's device performance is unaffected, and we can deploy more powerful models without user-side updates. Our prediction time of **1.5-2.5 seconds** is highly competitive. |
| **6. 202521019141** | SMART AGRICULTURE PLANT HEALTH MONITORING USING IOT AND LEAF DISEASE DETECTION... | A fully integrated, self-sustaining farm management system using IoT sensors and renewable energy to monitor plant health and automate irrigation. | IoT sensors for soil/air -> ML model (VGG16-like) for leaf disease detection -> an automated water pump -> all powered by solar and biogas. | General "Plants" | Leaves ("foliage") and the surrounding environment (soil, air). | General "Leaf diseases." | Not specified. | **1. Simplicity and Zero Infrastructure Cost:** Their system requires a massive capital investment in sensors, power systems, and installation. Our tool requires **zero infrastructure**â€”just a phone the farmer already owns.<br>**2. Focus and Precision:** We focus on providing best-in-class disease diagnosis, while they offer a complex, integrated system where diagnosis is just one part. |
| **7. 202241063004** | AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF COCONUT TREE LEAF DISEASES... USING RFID TAG | A system for monitoring individual coconut trees in a large grove by giving each tree an RFID tag and using a drone to scan for diseases. | Each tree is tagged with RFID -> a drone captures aerial images -> a Deep Neural Network (DNN) detects disease and links it to the specific tree's tag. | Coconut | Leaves (from an aerial view). | General "Fungus." Lists symptoms like yellow-brown spots, wilting, and shriveling. | Not specified. | **1. No Cumbersome Hardware:** Our tool eliminates the need for the expensive and time-consuming process of buying and physically attaching RFID tags to every tree, and it does not require a drone.<br>**2. Practical for All Crop Types:** Our upload-and-predict method is practical for row crops like black gram and eggplant, where individual tagging is impossible. |
| **8. 202441036135** | A METHOD TO CLASSIFY COCONUT TREES BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS | An AI system to classify the **physical shape** of coconut trees (e.g., height, lean) to assist with applications like robotic harvesting. **It does not detect diseases.** | Hybrid AI: Classic computer vision (LBP, HOG, PCA) extracts features, which are then fed into an **Inception Net** deep learning model and classified by an **SVM**. | Coconut | The entire tree's physical structure (morphology). | **None.** This patent is for shape classification only. | **95.35% accuracy.** | **1. Solves a More Critical Problem:** Their tool is for a niche structural analysis. Our tool addresses the universal, high-priority problem of **disease management**, which directly impacts crop yield and farmer income.<br>**2. Immediate Actionable Insights:** Our tool provides recommendations (fertilizer, pesticide, expert consultation) that a farmer can act on immediately to save their crops. |
| **9. 202411098990** | DISTRIBUTED MODEL SYSTEM FOR COCONUT DISEASE DIAGNOSIS USING FEDERATED LEARNING... | A privacy-focused AI system where coconut disease models are trained across many farmers' phones without anyone having to share their private photos. | **Federated Learning:** AI models are trained on each local device. Only anonymous model improvements are sent to a central server, which creates a better "global model" for everyone. | Coconut | Tree images, likely focused on leaves and stems. | Bud rot, leaf blight, and root wilt. | Not specified. The focus is on the privacy-preserving methodology. | **1. Superior Utility and Versatility:** While their methodology is novel for privacy, our tool's support for **five diverse plants** offers far greater practical value to the agricultural community. A farmer growing multiple crops can use one tool for all their needs.<br>**2. Centralized Reliability:** Our backend-based system ensures consistent performance and allows for rapid updates and improvements to the models without relying on the end-user's device for training. |
