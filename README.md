1. 202041045426	DISEASE DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION FOR COCONUT PLANTATION	A web application where farmers upload a photo of a coconut plant to get an instant disease diagnosis and treatment suggestion.	Image segmentation using K-Means Clustering, followed by classification with a customized CNN.	Coconut	Stem and Leaves	Directly Detects: Stem Bleeding, Stem Hole, Leaf Blight.<br>Also Mentioned: Basal Stem Rot (BST), Bud Rot, White Rot Fungus, Rhinoceros Beetle.	No specific numbers. Claims "superior accuracy" compared to other models and "instant" prediction time.
2. 202341016339	LEAF DISEASE DETECTION IN CROPS USING IMAGE PROCESSING AND MACHINE LEARNING...	A dedicated, physical hardware device with a built-in camera and screen for detecting leaf diseases on-site.	An integrated hardware system captures an image, processes it with internal clustering algorithms, and displays the result.	General "Crops"	Leaves	General "Leaf disease". No specific diseases are named.	Not specified.
3. 202441089832	A IOT BASED DETECTION OF COCONUT TREE PESTS AND DISEASES WITH PESTICIDE RECOMMENDATIONS...	A complete drone system that not only detects diseases in coconut trees but also automatically sprays the correct pesticide on affected areas.	A drone captures images -> AI analyzes them in real-time -> Alerts are sent to a mobile app -> The drone performs targeted pesticide spraying.	Coconut	Whole tree (aerial view), focusing on leaves and signs of infestation.	Black Stem Rot, Rhinoceros beetles.	Not specified. Focus is on "early detection" and "precision."
4. 202441051950	TRANSFORMATIVE APPLICATIONS OF AI AND ML IN AGRICULTURE...	A broad patent covering the entire field of using AI for farming, including crop/soil monitoring, livestock health, and yield prediction.	A high-level framework describing the use of AI/ML with data from drones, satellites, and sensors.	General "Crops" and "Livestock"	Whole fields, soil, and entire animals.	General "Pests and diseases" for plants.	Not specified.
5. 202521019962	SMART AGRICULTURE: EARLY TOMATO LEAF DISEASE DETECTION USING CNN-BASED DEEP LEARNING	A mobile application with a highly specialized AI model for detecting diseases in tomato leaves, designed to work offline on a phone.	A custom-built CNN with 8 convolutional blocks processes leaf images directly on the user's device (edge computing).	Tomato	Leaves	10 specific tomato leaf diseases (the patent does not name them).	96% accuracy.
6. 202521019141	SMART AGRICULTURE PLANT HEALTH MONITORING USING IOT AND LEAF DISEASE DETECTION...	A fully integrated, self-sustaining farm management system using IoT sensors and renewable energy to monitor plant health and automate irrigation.	IoT sensors for soil/air -> ML model (VGG16-like) for leaf disease detection -> an automated water pump -> all powered by solar and biogas.	General "Plants"	Leaves ("foliage") and the surrounding environment (soil, air).	General "Leaf diseases."	Not specified.
7. 202241063004	AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION OF COCONUT TREE LEAF DISEASES... USING RFID TAG	A system for monitoring individual coconut trees in a large grove by giving each tree an RFID tag and using a drone to scan for diseases.	Each tree is tagged with RFID -> a drone captures aerial images -> a Deep Neural Network (DNN) detects disease and links it to the specific tree's tag.	Coconut	Leaves (from an aerial view).	General "Fungus." Lists symptoms like yellow-brown spots, wilting, and shriveling.	Not specified.
8. 202441036135	A METHOD TO CLASSIFY COCONUT TREES BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS	An AI system to classify the physical shape of coconut trees (e.g., height, lean) to assist with applications like robotic harvesting. It does not detect diseases.	Hybrid AI: Classic computer vision (LBP, HOG, PCA) extracts features, which are then fed into an Inception Net deep learning model and classified by an SVM.	Coconut	The entire tree's physical structure (morphology).	None. This patent is for shape classification only.	95.35% accuracy.
9. 202411098990	DISTRIBUTED MODEL SYSTEM FOR COCONUT DISEASE DIAGNOSIS USING FEDERATED LEARNING...	A privacy-focused AI system where coconut disease models are trained across many farmers' phones without anyone having to share their private photos.	Federated Learning: AI models are trained on each local device. Only anonymous model improvements are sent to a central server, which creates a better "global model" for everyone.	Coconut	Tree images, likely focused on leaves and stems.	Bud rot, leaf blight, and root wilt.	Not specified. The focus is on the privacy-preserving methodology.
